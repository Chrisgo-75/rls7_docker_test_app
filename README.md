# README

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

1. Will need to add app.env to application root. And add SECRET_KEY_BASE='43lhk62k62lj6kllk236h'

2. Commands that I typically use to Build and Start up Docker container are:

```text
  $ docker compose build --no-cache --progress=plain
  $ docker compose up -d
  # When done, run
  $ docker compose down
```

3. Can access the application in browser at `localhost:3035`
